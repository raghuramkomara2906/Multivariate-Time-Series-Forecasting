# Multivariate-Time-Series-Forecasting
This assignment focuses on forecasting a single output at time t+1 using multivariate time series data. A financial dataset with daily stock prices and volume is used. Past observations are transformed using a sliding window and fed into an RNN model. The model's accuracy is evaluated using MSE and visualized with loss plots.
